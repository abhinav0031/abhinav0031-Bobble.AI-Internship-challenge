NOTE:
The login by facebook functionality is not working as i could not get appID from facebookdevelopers.com,i tried to make facebook account but my account got disabeled instantly
,and the facebook team has asked for some time to review my account,so if my account gets enabeled and i get appId,i can show you this functionality also,hopefully in next round.
